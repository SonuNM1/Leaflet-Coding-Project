### Technical terms or Concepts related to Map rendering and interactivity 


Layers: used to display different types of information on a map, like map tiles, markers, polygons, lines, and more. Each layer servers specific purpose and can be added or removed from the map independently. 

(For eg: one layer for displaying streets, one for showing markers, other for highlighting boundaries)



Tile Layers: specific type of layer that displays map data as a grid of square tiles. covers entire map area at different zoom levels. When we zoom the map, leaflet dynamically loads and displays the appropriate tiles for the new view. 

(Tile layer provider -- OpenStreetMap, Mapbox and Google maps)
